Dev Log - Kanban Board App
Feb 27, 2025

Spent about 4 hours on the app. Got most of the core features working, but had to make some tradeoffs to respect the time limit and not get too carried away.

What I accomplished:

Core functionality ~2h:
Built the basic kanban board with To Do, In Progress, and Done columns
Created task creation modal with all the metadata fields
Added ability to move tasks between columns via long-press
Made task cards expandable to show details
Added calendar selection for due dates

UI/UX ~1h:
Made the interface clean and intuitive
Created layouts for both phone and tablet
Added visual indicators for priorities and completion
Added feedback for user actions

Testing ~30m:
Tested on different screen sizes
Fixed edge cases in the task movement
Made sure it works in both orientations

Challenges:
Got the core functionality up pretty quickly, but then went down a rabbit hole trying to figure out drag and drop in react native (didnt realize it was more complicated than normal react). This took more time than expected, and I eventually had to backtrack and use a simpler action-sheet approach. This ended up being more reliable anyway, especially across different device sizes.
Added the calendar date picker since it was relatively quick to implement and seemed important for task management.
Given more time, I would add proper drag and drop, task filtering, mock API integration, local storage, and performance testing with many tasks. 
Overall, app has the essential functionality as a usable personal kanban app, but there's definitely room for enhancement. 

Was good exposure to react native, definitely helped brush up on mobile development. In the future might speed things up to use the new claude 3.7 cli feature, hearing some buzz abotu that if you're interested.
